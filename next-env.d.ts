// FIX: The triple-slash directives for Next.js types have been removed.
// They were causing "Cannot find type definition file" errors.
// In a modern Next.js project with the App Router, these global references
// are often not required because types are handled by direct imports
// and the Next.js TypeScript plugin.

// NOTE: This file should not be edited
// see https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript for more information.
